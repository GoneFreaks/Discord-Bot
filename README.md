# Discord-Bot

## Just a couple of guys having fun while creating the "successor" of groovy


Start the bot by typing **java -jar Gruwie.jar token configuration** into your console.
The token has to be created **on your own**, in order to prevent multiple clients from using a single token.

The bot has diffrent configurations, each of them can be adressed by using certain arguments

		0: Default
		1: No database
		2: No logging
		3: No database/logging
		
Configuration *0* and *1* can be used everytime, just keep in mind, that some features won't work in mode *1*.

Configuration *2* and *3* shouldn't be used unless you are a developer who can handle exceptions on his/her own.
