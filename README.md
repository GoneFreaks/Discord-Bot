# Gruwie the "successor" of Groovy

## This Bot is currently WIP and is just a fun-project and therefore a possibility to try and use JDA/Git

Start the bot by typing ***java -jar Gruwie.jar <token>*** into your console.

The bot has diffrent configurations, you can address each of them by modifying the ***config.properties File***.<br>
This file has to be in the **same** directory as the **.jar** while starting the bot, otherwise the Bot won't boot.<br>

The config has four datatypes:	

				boolean (default)
				String
				number
				float/double
										
If you use an unmatching datatype for a property, the Bot will use default-values instead.
				
The owner of Bot (the Account whose id is equals to the owner_id) can execute some Admin-Commands by typing them in a private-Chat with Gruwie.<br>
Keep in mind, that you can theoratically change every single config-Option and reload it, but this could cause unexpected behaviour.<br>
